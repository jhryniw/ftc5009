#FTC Team Helios 5009

*FTC Team Helios 5009* is a robotics team participating in *First Tech Challenge*.

This project is made for the *Velocity Vortex* challenge of the year 2016.

There's an TeleOp program in this reposiritory, which is the program that lets the drivers control the robot.
The TeleOp program uses the two joysticks of the controller to individually control a corresponding drive motor.

There's also an Autonomous program, it's a program that makes the robot run by itself with pre-written codes and pre-determined values. 
The Autonomous program is supposed to let the robot pivot on-the-spot or push the *Cap Ball* off of it's resting area.
